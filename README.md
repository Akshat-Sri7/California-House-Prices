# California-House-Prices
Another project on Linear Regression where I try to build a machine learning model to predict the house prices of California state.
Here, I make use of a publicly available data set from Kaggle (link)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features] to predict house prices of California state.
I use Linear Regression in my initial code which gives me a score of approximately 65%.
However, various other algorithms can give a better result.
