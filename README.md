# California-House-Prices
Another project on Linear Regression where I try to build a machine learning model to predict the house prices of California state.
Here, I make use of a publicly available data set from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features) to predict house prices of California state.
I use Linear Regression in my initial code which gives me a score of approximately 65%.
However, various other algorithms can give a better result.

**Dependencies**
*numpy  
*pandas  
*matplotlib  
*scikit-learn  

You can just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if you don't already have it.

# Usage 
The code is being written in Jupyter Notebook, I personally used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distributed jupyter notebook to write the code. I recommend using the same, to get the scatter plot and line of best fit without facing any memory or other issues.
